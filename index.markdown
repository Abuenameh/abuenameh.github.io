# Electronics Simulations

The following web apps can be used for electronics labs. Currently, there is only one.

## Sequential Logic

This web app was forked from Renato BÃ¶hler's **[logossim](https://github.com/renato-bohler/logossim){:target="_blank"}** and has been edited in the following ways:
- Addition of the ability to rotate components.
- Addition of JK, D, and T flip-flops.

The web app is available at <https://abuenameh.github.io/logossim/>.
