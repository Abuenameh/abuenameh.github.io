# Electronics Simulations

The following web apps can be used for electronics labs.

## Sequential Logic

This web app was forked from Renato Böhler's **[logossim](https://github.com/renato-bohler/logossim){:target="_blank"}** and has been edited in the following ways:
- Addition of the ability to rotate components.
- Addition of JK, D, and T flip-flops.
- Addition of the ability to record the signal at any points in the circuit.

The app is a work-in-progress, so there may be some bugs. Please save fairly often to help mitigate against that. To open the web app, click **[here](https://abuenameh.github.io/logossim/){:target="_blank"}**.

## Microprocessors

This web app was forked from **[Neutrino•8085 Emulator and Assembler](https://github.com/8085emu/8085emu.github.io){:target="_blank"}**. To open the web app, click **[here](https://abuenameh.github.io/8085emu/coder.html){:target="_blank"}**.
